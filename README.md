# polyhedra

### Git and C++ introduction

# Overview

This is meant to be an introduction to using Git and C++ syntax. Complete this
tutorial after doing a number of HackerRank problems (especially those in
**Classes** and **Inheritance**).

We will be implementing different types of convex polyhedra and computing their
volumes. The goal of this assignment is not to know how to compute the volume
of a Snub Dodecahedron, but to get a sense of Git and OOP in C++.
